# BolgAnalisys

This is test blog analisys about the most important topics

I analize the post list and I see that the topic list seems ordered by most relevant to lesser one, (so I'm assume it apply my logic on it)

In that case cause i do not found any filter for the post list i'll take a 2000 elemnts, i can suggest to add a possible filter by date to permit get data more exactly

For the first graph i use the BarStack graphic,
I prefer it to bargroup cause it's more easy to rapresent the data
(for each month the top topics list could be change and the group bar need to rapresent always all types )

To calculate the most rapresentatice topics for each month i apply calcualte the average of each topic montly and get the first 3 .
